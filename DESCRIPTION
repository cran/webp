Title: A New Format for Lossless and Lossy Image Compression
Version: 1.0
Author: Jeroen Ooms
Maintainer: Jeroen Ooms <jeroen@berkeley.edu>
Description: Lossless webp images are 26% smaller in size compared to PNG. Lossy
    webp images are 25-34% smaller in size compared to JPEG. This package reads
    and writes webp images into a 3 (rgb) or 4 (rgba) channel bitmap array using
    conventions from the 'jpeg' and 'png' packages.
